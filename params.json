From 2002 until 2014 I worked in Microsoft Research's Silicon Valley lab, on topics ranging from graph computation, to differential privacy, to distributed and data-parallel computation. I enjoy identifying general computational primitives and building systems around them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
