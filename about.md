I am a researcher and computer scientist, based in San Francisco. From 2002 until 2014 I worked in Microsoft Research's Silicon Valley lab, on topics ranging from graph computation, to differential privacy, to distributed and data-parallel computation.

I currently enjoy identifying general computational primitives and building systems around them.
